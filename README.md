# Erosion-Dashboard---NISR

The NISR has conducted the Seasonal Agriculture Survey for 2022 Season B. The data collection activities started from 2nd May and ended on 30th June 2023, covering 1,200 segments and 345 large-scale farmersâ€™ holdings across the country. Rwanda's total land area is 2.377 million hectares, with 1.345 million hectares (56.6%) dedicated to agriculture in 2023 Season B. Of this, 983,000 hectares were for seasonal crops, 540,000 hectares for permanent crops, and 124,000 hectares for permanent pasture. Major crop production saw an overall increase, except for Irish potatoes and paddy rice, which decreased by 1.3 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, compared to the last year Season B


For that reason we decide to make Erosion-Dashboard---NISR to show type of erosion Season A_Percentage of plots by degree of erosion per district
